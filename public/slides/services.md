* Services are probably the most important and useful building blocks in Angular
* A service is a *named* object/function that can be used by other services/controllers/widgets/directives
* Services are automatically injected as function arguments based on their name
* They can be used for communication between controllers
* Services are easy to replace (no monkey patching required)
