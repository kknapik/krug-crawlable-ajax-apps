* Selenium/Capybara are great... unless you are testing a JS heavy application
* Selenium has no way of knowing what is going on in the browser
* You have to either do a lot of polling, or sleeping
* In my experience Selenium crashes a lot without any reason
* Angular Scenario Runner understands exactly what is going on in the browser
* You can run it directly (very useful) or via js-test-driver
* [DEMO](http://docs.angularjs.org/docs-scenario.html)
